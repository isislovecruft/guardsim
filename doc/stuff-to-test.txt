Network scenarios (normal):
   * Normal network; all hosts up with P=x%
   * Network is down and looks down.
   * Network seems up but is down.
   * FascistFirewall; only 443 and 80 reachable. P=x%

   * User moves among above networks over time.

Guard behavior:
   * Guard goes away and comes back a lot
   * Guard stays up
   * Guard starts up, goes down.
   * Some change over time about which guards are Running/Guard/listed.

User behavior:
   * Regular
   * Bridge
   * FascistFirewall set.
   * Restart tor (when not working? Repeatedly)
   * HUP tor (when not working? repeatedly?)

Network scenarios (hostile)
   * Targeted guard takedown attack: attacker hits guards one after another.
   * Network under broad attack: many guards are flaky

   * Filtering at gateway; non-hostile fractino of Tor guards is unavailable.

   * Filtering at guard: guard blocks connections when it does not control
     path (out of scope?)
   *
